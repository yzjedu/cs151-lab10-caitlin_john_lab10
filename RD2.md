This assignment was difficult to understand at first but it eventually took shape. I enjoyed this project and the
new things I learned with it. Trying to understand a lot of the table operations possible in Python were difficult to
understand the first time around. I used some external resources like Python.org. An example of this was me not understanding
that .append() is used for adding to a row. Another issue was trying to figure out what function would have to come first
in this scenario; it required a lot more pre-planning than we expected.

Caitlin has been a wonderful partner throughout this and I am glad to have done this lab project. I hope to once again
use the information I have learned here in the foreseeable future.
