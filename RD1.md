- the objective of this lab was to practice reading and writing on files using functions. The steps we followed in this lab were creating an algorithm, writing the code, and making sure the code ran properly. The key concept explored in this labw as writing information and tables into a new output file. Our results did match what we expected to get when we started this lab. The main problem we encountered was figuring out the specifics of writing to new files, but we solved that by looking at the class notes. I do think I learned what I was supposed to learn for this lab because now I understand writng on files more than I did before. I liked working with my partner because we worked well together.
